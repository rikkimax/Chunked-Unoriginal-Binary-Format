## Chunked Unoriginal Binary Format

A simplistic format, meant for read only data.

Sister format for [command sequence data](https://github.com/rikkimax/csuf).

### Format:
The format has two things, chunks and a magic value at the start.
The chunk format is:

- ubyte[0 .. (Length-8)]: Values
- char[4]: Name
- uint: Hash, crc32
- uint: Length, (Hash length) + (Name length) + (Values length)

The magic value has the form (in bytes):

- ['c', 'u', 'b', 'f']
- One of: 'S'tart, 'E'nd, 'O'ffset
- One of: ['L', 'E'] or ['B', 'E']
- 0

If 'S'tart is selected, then the header will be immediately after the magic value.

If 'E'nd is selected, then the header will be the first chunk at the end of the file.

If 'O' is selected, then an offset of 8 bytes is specified immediately after the magic value. At that offset is 
the header chunk (offset == length of chunk).

Examples of the magic value (with offset) are: ``cubfSLE0``, ``cubfOBE068210000``.
